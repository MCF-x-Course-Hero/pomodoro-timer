## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 We got the timer to work well for our purposes.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 Adding a task was somewhat challenging with the way we have our sidebars set up but it all worked out in the end.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 We did not finish all that we have on our spring plan for this week. Partly stems from needing to do research, and things not going as intended. Additionally, we could've had used more time towards working on the project than demoing during the past week.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

Our mentors and Youtube has been a great resource for us in learning new things, one such example is adding tasks.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 At the moment, I don't think we find anything to be at risk.
