## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

This week we did a lot of CSS and fixing any bugs that we came across. Thanks to our  mentors who tested the deployed site and found bugs, we were able to go back and fix all the errors. We also took the feedback we recieved from demos and implemented some of those features onto our site. Another success for this week was being able to start implementing stretch features and making the overall site look clean and consistent!

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

Some challenges we came across this week was mainly due to the bugs we encountered. After deploying our website, many things in the backend were not working properly. So we had to go back and find the issue. Jose, created test files in the backend to ensure that all the test were passing which helped fix any bugs we had when deploying the site.
 
 
* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

We were able to complete all the tasks for the sprint this week which was mainly polishing (css) and deploying the website. Using zenhub and communicating with one another consistenly allowed for us to start implementing stretch features and finish our sprint tasks on time.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

We did not rely on the resources that were provided. Our group used external resources such as asking our mentors, reasearching different tutorials on how to implement a certain feature and learning as we build. For deploying our website, Jose created a detailed documentation https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pHwtI0yJXR0aDCNKX1ygQJUBgmZwz0PCgTDBMVw2sMg/edit that helped us finish this task without confusion.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

We completed all of our MVP features and what remains are some stretch features. We were able to start implementing background music, adding an about tab, and jest testing. Our method for completing stretch features is to have each person in the group choose what they decide to work on to make the process more enjoying. I would consider any stretch feature that was not implemented a risk simply because of a lack of time to be able to implement them.
