# Reflection #5

Pod Members: **Add Pod Members Names**

## Reflection Questions

* How was the pacing of the capstone project? (i.e too slow, just right, too fast) 

* To what extent did your plan change over the course of development? Knowing that you know now, what would you do differently if you were starting over?

* How helpful were the labs and weekly assignments in preparing you to create a capstone project? Be specific, what topics do you still have questions about that may or may not have been covered?


* When planning for the capstone project, which resources were the most helpful? (i.e mentors, instructors & TAs, ideation process, pod syncs, wireframes, sprint planning, bug bash, practice demo day, etc.)
