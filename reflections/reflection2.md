## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

We got almost all of our core features working! We are still working on the very last one, but we're really close to finishing that as well.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

We ran into several bugs throughout the week in both the frontend and backend which caused us to get behind a bit. There were a few features we were unsure how to implement, but we managed to overcome it all in the end :)

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

No, we are still missing a single feature that we had planned for this week. We are really close to completing it though; our group ran into several unexpected bugs that slowed us and kept us from progressing further. Our group plans to work over the weekend to complete that feature and do some extra css so we're more than ready for sprint 3. Next week, we will prioritize communicating and trying to lessen the amount of bugs we run into so as to not get stuck for too long on one issue.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 Yes! Our group has gone back several times to look at past projects we completed for insight on how we could implement features in our capstone. All the time spent on the backend was greatly appreciated. The more practice we get, the simpler it gets.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

We have several stretch features we probably won't be able to get to before the end of the final sprint. Next week we will focus on polishing our css and only adding a couple stretch features that we really want to include.
