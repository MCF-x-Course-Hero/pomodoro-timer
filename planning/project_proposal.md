## Problem Statement

For many students the hardest part of studying has always been focus.  Especially for several hours, holding your focus can be incredibly difficult. In order to solve this problem our team has decided to utilize the Pomodoro technique into our application. Our website will be designed to help students stay motivated in doing their work by providing a timer with breaks in between.

## Open Questions

What questions do you still have? What topics do you need to research more for your project?
* What does it take to make animations like the [cat](https://pomodorokitty.com/) in pomodoro kitty. Or is there some third party resource that we can utilize instead of making our own graphics and animations.
* How realistic is the scope of the core features?
* Do you feel that any of the stretch features should be a core feature, and vice versa.
* Do you think using copyrighted music for a non profit project is dangerous?
