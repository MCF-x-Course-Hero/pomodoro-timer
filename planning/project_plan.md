## Problem Statement and Description

For many students the hardest part of studying has always been focus.  Especially for several hours, holding your focus can be incredibly difficult. In order to solve this problem our team has decided to utilize the Pomodoro technique into our application. Our website will be designed to help students stay motivated in doing their work by providing a timer with breaks in between. 

## User Roles and Personas

### College Student
Hello, my name is John Smith and I am a  college student from San Francisco, California. I am  21 years old and currently a senior at San Francisco State University pursuing a degree in Software Engineering. I spend most of my time playing video games, studying with friends, and completing classwork on my laptop. Because of this, I am a night owl and often forget to get the day’s task done, and have trouble completing my tasks instead of procrastinating, sleeping earlier, and finding more time to study by myself. What I am looking for in a pomodoro timer is a feature that allows me to customize to dark mode which would allow me to be able to work during the night more productively. Additionally, having some kind of planner on the app allows me to be reminded of what task needs to be prioritized towards completion. Some potential pain points regarding the pomodoro timer is that I find it difficult to stick to a schedule.I am afraid that I may lack motivation throughout the work session. Because of this, adding some kind of reward when finishing a task within the allotted time will boost my productivity. But if I didn’t complete the task within time, then displaying an inspirational quote will help me in maintaining my drive to study and do better.


### Working Professional
My name is Will Smith and I live in  NY. I work as a product manager for a software engineering company. Despite being 40 years old, I’m well acquainted with modern software technology. I use my computer regularly on the job to plan out meetings, delegate tasks, and ensure that everyone contributes to the team. This pomodoro timer that I hear has been in the works is something that I would access through my computer. There are plenty of reasons for integrating this pomodoro timer into my workflow. The first thing I do in the morning is to check my emails and respond to them should they need it. If I can do that within 20 minutes without overthinking how to respond, then I can get an early head start on my day. Another way I plan to use this pomodoro timer is to manage meetings by making sure that I cover all of my agenda within a timely, and concise manner. However, an obstacle that I can see surfacing within this app is the lack of the option to take notes related to a task or a list item that needs to be addressed even after the timer runs out.
